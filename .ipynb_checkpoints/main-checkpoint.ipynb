    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "# My analysis here\n",
    "# Various reports have been generated taking in to consideration the number of students per school, their total average and total percentage of scores #in Maths and Reading subjects. THe scope of analysis is restricted to local government area only. The reports gives the comparative analysis of schools #in terms of thier performance in Maths and Reading (with Average and Total pass percentages). Some reports gives the top 5 and bottom 5 numbers based \n",
    "# on their pass percentage performance. Some reports gives a view of % percentage of Maths and Reading across 4 year grades. (Grade 9 to Grade 12). Some # reports even present the performance of students from each school including the spend on each student by respective schools. Overall the reports give # a correct view of each school in the local government area and will enable the residents in the local government area to take decisions for enrolling # their children in these schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusions below\n",
    "# 1. The pass by school size trend indicates that smaller the size of the school students, better the pass percentage across Maths and Reading\n",
    "# 2. The overall pass percentage seems to be higher for Independant schools than the government schools\n"
